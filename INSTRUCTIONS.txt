You are to implement a C tool similar to "ps x -o pid,comm,rss"
that will show for each process that shares your user ID the amount of
memory it is using. Scan the /proc directory to find all active
processes by their process ID (PID). You can find all of the
information you need for each process under /proc/$PID/status, in
particular the lines "Name", "Uid" and "VmRSS".

Your output should list on seperate lines the PID, binary name of the
process and the resident set size (RSS), separated by spaces.
Your process must return 0 upon successful completion.

Your C program must be called "ps.c".  You will be graded for style
(compiler warnings (-Wall), memory leaks, etc.) as well as for correct
output.

Test your program using the "test.sh".
